2.0 Software. The Software is protected by copyright under United States,

violate copyright, trademark and other laws. Licensor grants Subscriber the 
non-exclusive, non-transferable right and license to permit one End User the 
use of the Software on computer workstations located at his/her normal places 
of business, during the Term and subject to the terms and conditions of the 
Agreement. If Licensor provides Updates to Subscriber during the Term, the 
Updates will be provided at no additional charge. The terms of the Agreement 
will apply to all Updates provided to Subscriber. This grant is not a transfer 
of title, and under this license Subscriber may not: a) use, republish, 
upload, post or transmit in any way the Software except as expressly 
authorized pursuant to the Agreement; b) copy, reproduce, modify or create 
derivative works from the Software except as expressly authorized pursuant to

accessed through an electronic network beyond Subscriber's normal places of 
business; or g) transfer the Software to another person or 'mirror' the

3.0 Limitation of Liability. Licensor assumes no responsibility for the 
selection of the Software to achieve any intended purpose, for the proper use 
of Software or for verifying the results obtained from use of the Software. 
Licensee recognizes that the Software will interact with software provided by 
other suppliers, and accepts that Licensor assumes no responsibility for such 
use, interaction, performance issues, or failure to achieve any desired results.   
We warrant that for a period of 90 days after delivery of this copy of the 
Software: a) if the Software is provided on physical media by Licensor, the 
physical media on which this copy of the Software is provided to you will be 
free from defects in materials and workmanship under normal use, and b) the 
Software will perform in substantial accordance with the Documentation. To the 
extent permitted by applicable law, the foregoing limited warranty is in lieu 
of all other warranties or conditions, express or implied, and we disclaim any 
and all implied warranties or conditions, including any implied warranty of 
title, non-infringement, merchantability or fitness for a particular purpose, 
regardless of whether we know or had reason to know of your particular needs. 
No employee, agent, dealer or distributor of ours is authorized to modify this 
limited warranty, nor to make any additional warranties. Some states do not 
allow the limitation or exclusion of liability for incidental or consequential 
damages, so the above limitation may not apply to you. Licensor entire 
liability and Subscriber’s exclusive remedy for breach of the foregoing 
warranty shall be, at our option, to either: a) return the price you paid, or 
b) repair or replace the Software that does not meet the foregoing warranty if 
it is returned to us with a copy of your receipt. In no event will Licensor be 
liable to you for any damages, including any lost profits, lost savings, or 
other incidental or consequential damages arising from the use or the 
inability to use the Software (even if Licensor or an authorized dealer or 
distributor has been advised of the possibility of these damages), or for any 
claim by any other party.

Software and remains effective until terminated. The Agreement shall 
immediately and automatically terminate without notice or any other act upon 
i) the expiry of the Term; ii) the attempted illegal copying, distribution, 
transfer, assignment, lease or sale of the Software, or rights thereto, 
without the prior written consent of Licensor; or iii) notice in writing 
given by one party to the other upon the violation by that party of any 
provision of the Agreement. Upon termination of the Agreement, Subscriber will 
forthwith cease use of the Software and destroy all originals and copies of 
the Software or any portion thereof, stored in any form, including electronic 
form on any of its computer equipment. Upon Licensor's request, Subscriber 
will provide a written certification that all the copies of the Softwaren, in 
whole or in part in any form have been destroyed. Failure to do so may result 
in additional fees and charges being levied against Subscriber. Any and all 
use of the Software by Subscriber following termination of the Agreement is 
prohibited and may result in additional fees and charges being levied against 
Subscriber.

know-how that belong to the Licensor and it is being made available to you in

algorithms, protocols or interfaces, other than in strict accordance with the 
Agreement may be actionable as a violation of licensor trade secret rights.

by reason of or as a consequence of Subscribers use of the Software.

the parties and supersedes all prior agreements and understandings, oral and

relation to the Agreement may be filed only in the state or federal courts of

personal and exclusive jurisdiction of such courts. If any one or more of the 
provisions contained in the Agreement should be invalid, illegal or 
unenforceable in any respect in any jurisdiction, the validity, legality and 
enforceability of such provision or provisions shall not in any way be 
affected or impaired as a result of such event in any other jurisdiction and 
the validity, legality and enforceability of the remaining provisions 
contained in the Agreement shall not in any way be affected or impaired as a 
result of such event, unless in either case as a result of such determination 
the Agreement would fail in its essential purpose.
